# Ghost Google Drive
[Google drive storage](https://github.com/robincsamuel/ghost-google-drive) for ghost allows you to store the contents on google drive. I believe its helpful if you are gonna host your ghost app on heroku.  

Will work with version higher than `0.6.0` of Ghost!

### What's is new in 2.x
 - Rewritten to add support to Ghost 2.x.

## Installation
### Via NPM

- cd into Ghost's `current` directory and install `ghost-google-drive` storage module

  ```
  cd current
  npm install ghost-google-drive
  ```
- cd back to the root directory and make the storage folder if it doesn't exist yet

  ```
  mkdir content/adapters/storage
  ```
- Copy the module into the right location

  ```
  cp -vR current/node_modules/ghost-google-drive content/adapters/storage/ghost-google-drive
  ```
- Install package dependencies

  ```
  cd content/adapters/storage/ghost-google-drive
  npm install
  ```


### Via Git

In order to replace the storage module, the basic requirements are:

- Clone this repo to `/content/adapters/storage`. Please create the directories if not there.

  ```
  cd [path/to/ghost]/content/adapters/storage
  git clone https://github.com/robincsamuel/ghost-google-drive.git
  ```
- Install dependencies

  ```
  cd ghost-google-drive
  npm install
  ```


## Configuration

Add the following to your environment configuration, `config.development.json` if development.

```js
"storage": {
  "active": "ghost-google-drive",
  "ghost-google-drive": {
    "key": {
            "private_key_id": "YOUR PRIVATE KEY ID",
            "private_key": "YOUR PRIVATE KEY",
            "client_email": "YOUR CLIENT EMAIL",
            "client_id": "YOUR CLIENT ID"
     }
  }
},

```
You just have to replace the key object with your json array generated by google console.
