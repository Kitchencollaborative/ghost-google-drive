# Ghost Google Drive
[Google drive storage](https://github.com/robincsamuel/ghost-google-drive) for ghost allows you to store the contents on google drive. I believe its helpful if you are gonna host your ghost app on heroku.  

Will work with version higher than `0.6.0` of Ghost!

### What's is new in 2.x
 - Rewritten to add support to Ghost 2.x.

## Installation

### Via Git

In order to replace the storage module, the basic requirements are:

- Clone this repo to `/content/adapters/storage`. Please create the directories if not there.

  ```
  cd [path/to/ghost]/content/adapters/storage
  git clone https://github.com/robincsamuel/ghost-google-drive.git
  ```
- Install dependencies

  ```
  cd ghost-google-drive
  npm install
  ```
  

## Create OAuth credentials

- Login to [google console](https://code.google.com/apis/console)
- Create new project from the top right dropdown

- After clicking `Create` button, google will generate a json file with the credentials for you. **Save it and don't lose!** 

## Configuration

Add the following to your environment configuration, `config.development.json` if development.

```js
"storage": {
  "active": "ghost-google-drive",
  "ghost-google-drive": {
    "key": {
            "private_key_id": "YOUR PRIVATE KEY ID",
            "private_key": "YOUR PRIVATE KEY",
            "client_email": "YOUR CLIENT EMAIL",
            "client_id": "YOUR CLIENT ID",
     }
  }
},

```
You just have to replace the key object with your json array generated by google console.
